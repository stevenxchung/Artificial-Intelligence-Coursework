# Week 3 - Enhancing Vision with Convolutional Neural Networks

Previously, we created a neural network (deep neural network) to pattern match a set of fashion items to labels. In this lesson we will go over how we can use convolutional neural networks to reduce wasted space in each image and focus on the pixels with valuable information.
