# What is AI?

AI can be broken up into two separate classifications:

- **Artificial narrow intelligence (ANI)**:
  - _One trick ponies_ - very specialized AI which can solve one problem, lots of progress has been made in this area which makes people believe lots of progress has been made to AGI
- **Artificial general intelligence (AGI)**:
  - AI designed to mimic human behaviors and intelligence or far exceed human behavior and intelligence, little progress has been made in this area despite what media believes and we are still many major breakthroughs away from creating this kind of intelligence

## Machine Learning

- **Supervised learning**: learns input (A) to output (B) mappings
- Neural networks and deep learning have accelerated performance for machine learning algorithms where previously, having a large amount of data did not improve performance

## What is data?

- Data can come in many different mediums (e.g., images, audio, text), it is up to the company to decide what is _A_ and what is _B_
- Although data is important data can be misused:
  - Some companies believe that you need to gather a lot of data before handing it to the AI team when in fact the AI team could have added value in the form of a feedback loop to the company
  - Some companies believe that having a lot of data means that the AI team would be able to find value from the data set but this is not always the case
- Quality of data matters, by default data is messy and if you train your algorithm with bad data then you will get poor results (garbage in, garbage out)

## The terminology of AI

- **Machine learning**: field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed
- **Data science**: science of extracting knowledge and insights from data
- **Deep learning**:
  - An algorithm with a neural network which utilizes _A_ to produce _B_ where a neural network is just a big mathematical equation which effectively produces the output
  - Deep learning and neural network are used almost interchangeably and one must note that the way an artificial neural network works is completely different from the way a biological neural network works

## What makes an AI company?

- Just as a company that uses the internet is not an internet company, a company that uses deep learning to solve problems does not mean they are an AI company
- AI companies are companies which are doing things that AI allows to be done well:
  - Strategic data acquisition
  - Unified data warehouse
  - Pervasive automation
  - New roles and division of labor
- To facilitate AI transformation:
  1. Execute pilot projects to gain momentum
  2. Build an in-house AI team
  3. Provide broad AI training
  4. Develop an AI strategy
  5. Develop an internal and external communications

## What machine learning can and cannot do

- A general rule of thumb is that anything you can do with one second of thought, we can probably now or soon automate with supervised learning
- Machine learning can help with recognizing and redirecting emails but it is very difficult to actually create an algorithm which can generate empathetic responses to emails
- What makes an machine learning problem easier?
  1. Learning a _simple_ concept (i.e., it only takes about one second of thought)
  2. Lots of data available
