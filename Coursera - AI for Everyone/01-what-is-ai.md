# What is AI?

AI can be broken up into two separate classifications:

- Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI):
  - _One trick ponies_ - very specialized AI which can solve one problem, lots of progress has been made in this area which makes people believe lots of progress has been made to AGI
- Artificial General Intelligence (AGI):
  - AI designed to mimic human behaviors and intelligence or far exceed human behavior and intelligence, little progress has been made in this area despite what media believes and we are still many major breakthroughs away from creating this kind of intelligence
