# Week 1 Quiz

1. Which of these terms best describes the type of AI used in today’s email spam filters, speech recognition, and other specific applications? Answer: _Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI)_

2. What do you call the commonly used AI technology for learning input (A) to output (B) mappings? Answer: _Supervised learning_

3. You want to use supervised learning to build a speech recognition system. The figure above (shown in lecture) suggests that in order for a neural network (deep learning) to achieve the best performance, you would ideally use: (Select all that apply)

   - _A large dataset (of audio files and the corresponding text transcript)_
   - _A large neural network_

4. The only way to acquire data for a supervised learning algorithm is to manually label it. I.e., given the input A, to ask a human to provide B. Answer: _False_

5. Which of these statements regarding data acquisition do you agree with? Answer: _Some types of data are more valuable than others; working with an AI team can help you figure out what data to acquire._

6. You run a company that manufactures scooters. Which of the following are examples of unstructured data? (Select all that apply.)

   - _Pictures of your scooters_
   - _Audio files of the engine sound of your scooters_

7. Suppose you run a website that sells cat food. Which of these might be a good result from a Data Science project? (Select all that apply.)

   - _Insights into how to market cat food more effectively, depending on the breed of cat._
   - _A slide deck presenting a plan on how to modify pricing in order to improve sales._

8. Based on the terminology defined in Video 4, which of the following statements do you agree with? (Select all that apply.)

   - _The terms “Deep learning” and “neural network” are used almost interchangeably._
   - _Deep learning is a type of machine learning. (I.e., all deep learning algorithms are machine learning algorithms.)_

9. Which of these do AI companies do well? Answer: _All of the above_

10. Say you want to input a picture of a person’s face (A), and output whether or not they are smiling (B). Because this is a task that most humans can do in less than 1 second, supervised learning can probably learn this A-to-B mapping. Answer: _True_
