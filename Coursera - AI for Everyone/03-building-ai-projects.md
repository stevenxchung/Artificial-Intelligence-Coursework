# Building AI Projects

There are several steps to follow when building an AI project:

- Workflow of projects
- Selecting AI projects
- Organizing data and team for the projects

## Workflow of a machine learning project

- Key steps of a machine learning project:
  1. Collect data
  2. Train model (iterate many times until good enough)
  3. Deploy model (get data back and maintain/update model)

## Workflow of a data science project

- Key steps of a data science project:
  1. Collect data
  2. Analyze data (iterate many times to get good insights)
  3. Suggest hypothesis/actions (deploy changes and re-analyze new data periodically)

## Every job function needs to learn how to use data

- Digitization of our society has introduced machine learning into many different fields and industries:
  - Sales: optimize sale funnel and prioritize points of contact
  - Manufacturing: optimize manufacturing (minimum waste) and scan for defects
  - Recruiting: optimize recruiting steps and automate resume screening
  - Marketing: A/B testing and customized recommendations
  - Agriculture: crop analytics and precision weed detection
