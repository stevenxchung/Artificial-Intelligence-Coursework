# Building AI Projects

There are several steps to follow when building an AI project:

- Workflow of projects
- Selecting AI projects
- Organizing data and team for the projects

## Workflow of a machine learning project

- Key steps of a machine learning project:
  1. Collect data
  2. Train model (iterate many times until good enough)
  3. Deploy model (get data back and maintain/update model)

## Workflow of a data science project

- Key steps of a data science project:
  1. Collect data
  2. Analyze data (iterate many times to get good insights)
  3. Suggest hypothesis/actions (deploy changes and re-analyze new data periodically)

## Every job function needs to learn how to use data

- Digitization of our society has introduced machine learning into many different fields and industries:
  - Sales: optimize sale funnel and prioritize points of contact
  - Manufacturing: optimize manufacturing (minimum waste) and scan for defects
  - Recruiting: optimize recruiting steps and automate resume screening
  - Marketing: A/B testing and customized recommendations
  - Agriculture: crop analytics and precision weed detection

## How to choose an AI project

- Gather AI knowledge and domain experts:
  - AI experts: figures out what AI can do
  - Domain experts: figures out what is valuable for your business
- Brainstorming framework
  - Think about automating tasks rather than automating jobs
  - What are the main drivers of business value?
  - What are the main pain points in your business?
- You can make progress even without big data
  - Having more data almost never hurts
  - Data makes some businesses (like web search) defensible
  - But with small datasets, you can still make progress
- Due diligence on project:
  - Technical diligence:
    - Can AI system meet desired performance?
    - How much data is needed?
    - Engineering timeline
  - Business diligence:
    - Lower costs
    - Increase revenue
    - Launch new product or business
  - Ethical diligence:
    - Is what you are doing benefiting humanity and society?
- Build vs buy:
  - ML projects can be in-house or outsourced
  - DS projects are more commonly done in-house
  - Some things will be industry standard - avoid building those

## Working with an AI team

- How to work with an AI team?
  - Specify your acceptance criteria, provide AI team a test set (dataset on which to measure their performance)
- How AI teams think about data:
  - Training set: dataset given to ML algorithm to learn _A_ to _B_ mapping
  - Test set: dataset given to ML algorithm to test if _A_ to _B_ mapping is valid or acceptable
- Pitfall: expecting 100% accuracy
  - Limitations of ML
  - Insufficient data
  - Mislabeled data
  - Ambiguous labels
