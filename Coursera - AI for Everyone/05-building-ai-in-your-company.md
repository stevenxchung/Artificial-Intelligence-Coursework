# Building AI in Your Company

How to build AI in your company?

- Case studies of complex AI products
- Roles in an AI team
- AI Transformation Playbook
- Taking your first step

## Case study: Smart speaker

- Typical functions:

  - Play music
  - Volume up/down
  - Make call
  - Current time
  - Units conversion
  - Simple question

- Steps to process commands:
  1. Trigger word/wakeword detection
  2. Speech recognition
  3. Intent recognition
  4. Specialized program to execute command

## Case study: Self-driving car

- Steps for deciding how to drive:
  1. Image/radar/lidar
  2. Car detection and pedestrian detection
  3. Motion planning
  4. Steer/accelerate/brake
- Key steps for self-driving car become:
  1. Car detection
  2. Pedestrian detection
  3. Motion planning

## Example roles of an AI team

- Different types of roles on an AI team:
  - Software engineer: writes custom and specialized software
  - Machine learning engineer: writes algorithm for _A_ to _B_ mapping
  - Machine learning researcher: extend state-of-the-art in ML
  - Applied ML scientist: adapt work from research into practice
  - Data scientist: examine data and provide insights
  - Data engineer: optimizes data storage in secure and cost effective ways
  - AI Product Manager: help decide what to build; what's feasible and valuable
- Getting started with a small team:
  - One software engineer
  - One machine learning/data scientist
  - Nobody but yourself

## AI Transformation Playbook

- There are five steps to the AI Transformation Playbook:
  1. Execute pilot projects to gain momentum
     - More important for the initial project to succeed rather than be the most valuable
     - Show traction within 6-12 months
     - Can be in-house or outsourced
  2. Build an in-house AI team
     - Build a centralized AI team
     - Take talent from AI team and matrix them into different business units
  3. Provide broad AI training
     - AI training should be given at each role (training will vary)
  4. Develop an AI strategy
     - Leverage AI to create an advantage specific to your industry sector
     - Design strategy aligned with the _Virtuous Cycle of AI_
     - Consider creating a data strategy
       - Strategic data acquisition
       - Unified data warehouse
     - Create network effects and platform advantages
       - In industries with _winner take all_ dynamics, AI can be an accelerator
  5. Develop internal and external communications
     - Investor relations
     - Government relations
     - Consumer/user education
     - Talent/recruitment
     - Internal communications

## AI pitfalls to avoid

- Don't:
  - Expect AI to solve everything
  - Hire 2-3 ML engineers and count solely on them to come up with use cases
  - Expect the AI project to work the first time
  - Expect traditional planning processes to apply without changes
  - Think you need superstar AI engineers before you can do anything
- Do:
  - Be realistic about what AI can and cannot do given limitations of technology, data, and engineering resources
  - Pair engineering talent with business talent and work cross-functionally to find feasible and valuable projects
  - Plan for AI development to be an iterative process, with multiple attempts needed to succeed
  - Work with AI team to establish timeline estimates, milestones, KPIs, etc.

## Taking your first step in AI

- Some initial steps you can take:
  - Get friends to learn about AI
    - This course
    - Reading group
  - Start brainstorming projects
    - No project is too small
  - Hire a few ML/DS people to help
  - Hire or appoint an AI leader (VP AI, CAIO, etc.)
  - Discuss with CEO/Board possibilities of AI Transformation
    - Will your company be much more valuable and/or more effective if it were good at AI?
