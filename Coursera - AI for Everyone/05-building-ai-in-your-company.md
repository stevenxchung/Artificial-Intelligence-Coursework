# Building AI in Your Company

How to build AI in your company?

- Case studies of complex AI products
- Roles in an AI team
- AI Transformation Playbook
- Taking your first step

## Case study: Smart speaker

- Typical functions:

  - Play music
  - Volume up/down
  - Make call
  - Current time
  - Units conversion
  - Simple question

- Steps to process commands:
  1. Trigger word/wakeword detection
  2. Speech recognition
  3. Intent recognition
  4. Specialized program to execute command

## Case study: Self-driving car

- Steps for deciding how to drive:
  1. Image/radar/lidar
  2. Car detection and pedestrian detection
  3. Motion planning
  4. Steer/accelerate/brake
- Key steps for self-driving car become:
  1. Car detection
  2. Pedestrian detection
  3. Motion planning

## Example roles of an AI team

- Different types of roles on an AI team:
  - Software engineer: writes custom and specialized software
  - Machine learning engineer: writes algorithm for _A_ to _B_ mapping
  - Machine learning researcher: extend state-of-the-art in ML
  - Applied ML scientist: adapt work from research into practice
  - Data scientist: examine data and provide insights
  - Data engineer: optimizes data storage in secure and cost effective ways
  - AI Product Manager: help decide what to build; what's feasible and valuable
- Getting started with a small team:
  - One software engineer
  - One machine learning/data scientist
  - Nobody but yourself
