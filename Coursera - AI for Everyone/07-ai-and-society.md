# AI and Society

We will cover the following topics:

- AI and hype
- AI and ethics
  - Limitations of AI
    - Bias
    - Adversarial attacks
  - AI, developing economies, and jobs
- Conclusion

## A realistic view of AI

- Goldilocks rule for AI:
  - Too optimistic: sentient/super-intelligent AI killer robots coming soon
  - Too pessimistic: AI cannot do everything, so an AI winter is coming
  - Just right: AI cannot do everything, but will transform industries
- Limitations of AI:
  - Performance limitations
  - Explaining is hard (but sometimes doable)
  - Biased AI through biased data
  - Adversarial attacks on AI

## Discrimination/Bias

- AI learning unhealthy stereotypes:
  - The way a ML algorithm stores words and relationships can lead to bias
- Why bias matters:
  - Hiring tool that discriminated against women
  - Facial recognition working better for light-skinned than dark-skinned individuals
  - Bank loan approvals
  - Toxic effect of reinforcing unhealthy stereotypes
- Combating bias:
  - Technical solutions:
    - E.g., "zero-out" the bias in words
    - Use less biased and/or more inclusive data
  - Transparency and/or auditing processes
  - Diverse workforce
    - Creates less biased applications

## Adversarial attacks on AI

- Examples:
  - Hummingbird + minor perturbation -> hammer
  - Hare + minor perturbation -> desk
- Physical attacks:
  - Classifies random person as a well-known actress
  - Fails to see stop sign when characters are applied to stop sign
  - Banana incorrectly identified as a toaster when sticker is placed near banana
- Adversarial defense:
  - Defenses do exist, but incur some cost
  - Similar to spam vs. anti-spam, we man be in an arms races for some applications

## Adverse uses of AI

- DeepFakes
  - Synthesize video of people doing things they never did
- Undermining of democracy and privacy
  - Oppressive surveillance
- Generating fake comments
- Spam vs. anti-spam and fraud vs. anti-fraud

## AI and developing economies

- Developing economies
  - _Leapfrog_
  - Mobile phones
  - Mobile payments
  - Online education
- How developing economies can build AI
  - US and China are leading, but all AI communities are still immature
  - Focus on AI to strengthen a country's vertical industries
  - Public-private partnerships to accelerate development
  - Invest in education

## AI and jobs

- AI's impact on jobs worldwide:
  - McKinsey estimates that jobs displaced by 2030 will be around 400-800M
  - However, jobs created by 2030 will be around 555-890M
- Some solutions:
  - Conditional basic income: provide a safety net but incentivize learning
  - Lifelong learning
  - Political solutions
