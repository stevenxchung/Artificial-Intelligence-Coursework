# Week 2

Previously, we saw that we could use machine learning, data, and labels, and have a computer figure out the rules. This week we will go into applying this concept to computer vision.

## An Introduction to Computer Vision

- Computer vision is the field of having a computer understand and label what is present in an image.
- We will look at how to train a computer with the Fashion MNIST dataset (contains 70K images spread acorss 10 different items of clothing) which will then allow the computer to identify similar pieces of clothing
