# Week 3

1. What is a Convolution? Answer: _A technique to isolate features in images_

2. What is Pooling? Answer: _A technique to reduce the information in an image while maintaining features_

3. How do Convolutions improve image recognition? Answer: _They isolate features in images_

4. After passing a 3 x 3 filter over a 28 x 28 image, how big will the output be? Answer: _26 x 26_

5. After max pooling a 26x26 image with a 2x2 filter, how big will the output be? Answer: _13 x 13_

6. Applying Convolutions on top of our Deep neural network will make training: _It depends on many factors. It might make your training faster or slower, and a poorly designed Convolutional layer may even be less efficient than plain DNN!_
