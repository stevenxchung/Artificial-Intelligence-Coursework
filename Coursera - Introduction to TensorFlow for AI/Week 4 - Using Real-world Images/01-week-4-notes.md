# Week 4 - Using Real-world Images

Previously, we learned how we could use CNN (convolutional neural networks) to improve computer vision. However, these techniques were limited in that we only looked at 28 x 28 images which were centered. This week we will see how we can apply the core idea of CNN to more complex problems.
