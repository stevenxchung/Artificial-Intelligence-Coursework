Let’s now create your own image classifier for complex images. See if you can create a classifier for a set of happy or sad images that I’ve provided. Use a callback to cancel training once accuracy is greater than .999.

Below is code with a link to a happy or sad dataset which contains 80 images, 40 happy and 40 sad. Create a convolutional neural network that trains to 100% accuracy on these images, which cancels training upon hitting training accuracy of >.999

Hint -- it will work best with 3 convolutional layers.
